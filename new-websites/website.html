            <p>Ayurvedic massage is a key part of Ayurvedic therapy. Just as a machine needs to be oiled, the body loves to have its largest organ, the skin, soothed, which is why oils are commonly used in Ayurvedic massage.Whether the Ayurvedic massage forms part of a more comprehensive Ayurveda programme or is merely undertaken for the sheer pleasure of a deeply relaxing, indulgent body massage; Ayurvedic massage is one of Ancient Indiaâ€™s best-kept secrets.Ayurvedic massage should be carried out every day to promote positive health, overcome fatigue, strengthen the nervous system, improve eyesight, nourish the bodily tissues, increase longevity, normalise sleep, instil flexibility and sturdiness as well as to maintain good health in general.</p>

            <h3>(Swedana) Steam Room</h3>
            <img src="images/steam_bath.jpg">
            <p>As the skin acts as a doorway for the elimination of toxins, it is also referred to as the "third kidney" of the human body. When Swedana is applied to the patient, heat of a steam accelerates the chemical processes inside the body to excrete the accumulated toxins out of the body.</p><p>Millions of sweat glands make passage for the excretion of metabolic and other waste products hence reducing fluid retention inside the body. Opening up of pores through Swedana also stimulates perspiration allowing the emission of toxins and other impurities through the skin. All this makes Swedana an effective ayurvedic therapy that helps kidneys and liver in detoxification of blood</p>

            <h3>Our Resort Retreat</h3>
            <img src="images/retrea.jpg">
            <p>The rooms, villas and suites are a perfect blend of Kerala's traditional architectural charm with luxurious, modern comforts. Each is a careful reconstruction of manas, the 16th century traditional homesteads of Kerala with many such manas having been transplanted from their original locations and reassembled painstakingly by hand, plank by plank, tile by tile, to create the luxurious abodes.</p>
            <p>The traditionally styled, luxuriously modern, open-roofed bathrooms set in small, aesthetically designed courtyards are a common feature to the villas and suites </p>
